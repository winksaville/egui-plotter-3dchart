# egui-plotter-3dchart

This is [example/3dchart.rs](https://github.com/Gip-Gip/egui-plotter/blob/c13ddc7dcd2e1b5be77cb3ad92db3c256845c78e/examples/3dchart.rs)
so that I can play around and learn more about egui-plotter, egui.

Note: currently the using
```
egui-plotter = { git = "https://github.com/winksaville/egui-plotter.git", branch = "update-eframe-egui-to-0.23" }
```
so it compiles, if `egui-plotter = "0.3"` is used I see a compile `error[E0107]: struct takes 0 generic arguments but 1 generic argument was supplied`

## How to run

```bash
cargo run
```
